RxSwift Tutorial Notes from Beginning RxSwift - Lesson 1

* What is RxSwift? 
    * its based on ReactiveX a standard based on reactive programming 
    * Created in 2015
    * An asynchronous programming library that is based on using observables
        * observables: a sequence of events that you can react to 
            * such as data from a web service or taps from a user
        * observables are represented by marble diagrams
            * horizontal line represents time
            * marbles represent events that happen over time
* Benefits of RxSwift
    * Easier to follow stream of logic
